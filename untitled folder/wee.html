            <h2>In class 53 I was introduced to the open-source development framework created by facebook for making android apps, React-native. 
                Before we began coding, I learned the differnce between creatain languages, such as javascript which is an imperative language. 
                We then started by creating a button by "importing" it and then giving it characteristics through a stylesheet. We used a new language
                called JSX which I wrote in 'snack', an editor similar to p5 as it had the files, code and output arranged in a similar manner.
